## Welcome to the hotel app
This is a basic hotel app idea that I've come up with for this project. It will be my first project coded in C++.

### Details of the project
---
When the project is executed in the IDE (Integrated Development Environment), there will be a terminal (console) that will pop up, showing four options. These options are: learn more about various facilities; learn more about breakfast, lunch, and dinner; learn more about pricing; book your stay; and then the terminal (console) will ask you to input a number ranging from one to four. If the number is invalid or is out of range, the programme ends. After you've entered a number according to the options, the terminal will show you a description based on your option.

### Screenshots of the project
---
Note: I've used HTML to customize the width and the hight, so I recommend to use a PC to view these images or go to the screenshots folder in Hotel-app/Screenshots.

There will be a list of options you can choose from ranging from one to four then the terminal will ask you to input an option number.

To help you navigate around the hotel more, I've added a short guide to many of the hotel's facilities. This includes, "when will the gym be open?".

Learning when the hotel will serve to customers is a good pick if you love to dine in & eat.

Aren't you worried about the hotel's prices? Don't worry, this guide will help you list down all the charges.

Time to book your hotel. This guide will ask you for more information about your intended stay in the hotel.

Finally, after making a final confirmation, there will be an overview of all your charges. If you are not sure about some charges, you can look at the pricing breakdown.
