## Welcome to the hotel app
This is a basic hotel app idea that I've come up with for this project. Since it is my first ever project using C++, I do not want to complicate things.

### Details of the project
---
When this project is ran in the IDE, there will a terminal (console) that will pop up showing 4 options. These options are, learn more about various facilities, learn more about breakfast, lunch and dinner, learn more about the pricing, and book your stay and then the terminal (console) will ask you to input a number ranging from one to four. If the number is invalid or the number is out of range, the program ends.

There will be a list of options you can choose from ranging from one to four then the terminal will ask you to input an option number.

To help you navigate around the hotel more, I've added a short guide to many of the hotel's facilities. This includes, "when will the gym be open?".

Learning when the hotel will serve to customers is a good pick if you love to dine in & eat.

Aren't you worried about the hotel's prices? Don't worry, this guide will help you list down all the charges.

Time to book your hotel. This guide will ask you for more information about your intended stay in the hotel.

Finally, after making a final confirmation, there will be a overview of all your charges. If you are not sure about some charges, you can look at the pricing breakdown.
