## Welcome to the hotel app
This is a basic hotel app idea that I've come up with for this project. Since it is my first ever project using C++, I do not want to complicate things.

### Details of the project
---
When this project is ran in the IDE, there will a terminal (console) that will pop up showing 4 options. These options are, learn more about various facilities, learn more about breakfast, lunch and dinner, learn more about the pricing, and book your stay and then the terminal (console) will ask you to input a number ranging from one to four. If the number is invalid or the number is out of range, the program ends.
